# Real-Time-Moving-Object-Detection-using-OpenCV
‚úÖ Project name
Moving Object Detection using OpenCV

‚úÖ Description
This project implements a real-time moving object detection system using OpenCV and Python. By capturing video from the webcam, the program identifies changes in the scene by comparing the current frame with a reference background frame. It processes each frame using grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, frame differencing, and binary thresholding. Detected motion areas are highlighted with bounding rectangles and a status message is overlaid on the frame. This system can serve as the foundation for security surveillance, motion-triggered recording, and smart automation applications. It demonstrates foundational computer vision techniques like background subtraction, contour detection, and frame annotation.

üîç Key Features:

Real-time video capture and processing using cv2.VideoCapture()

Background subtraction using Gaussian blur and frame differencing

Contour detection to identify and localize moving objects

Visual feedback using bounding boxes and status labels on the frame
